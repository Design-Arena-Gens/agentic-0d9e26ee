      <h1>What is copywriting?</h1>
      <p>
        Copywriting is the practice of writing words that persuade people to take a
        specific action. Those actions might include clicking a button, signing up for a
        newsletter, starting a free trial, making a purchase, or simply continuing to
        read. Unlike general writing, copywriting is measured by outcomes?how
        effectively the words move someone closer to a decision.
      </p>

      <h2>Where copywriting shows up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Websites and landing pages</li>
        <li>Ads (search, social, display, outdoor)</li>
        <li>Emails and SMS campaigns</li>
        <li>Product and app interfaces (microcopy)</li>
        <li>Sales pages, onboarding flows, checkout screens</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Core principles</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Audience first:</strong> Understand who you are speaking to, what they
          want, and what holds them back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Value before features:</strong> Explain outcomes and benefits; support
          with features and proof.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clarity beats cleverness:</strong> Simple, specific language converts
          better than vague slogans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structure matters:</strong> Good headlines, scannable sections, and
          strong calls to action guide readers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proof reduces risk:</strong> Use testimonials, data, guarantees, and
          demos to build trust.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Basic formula you can use</h2>
      <p>
        A practical pattern is <strong>Problem ? Promise ? Proof ? Proposal ? Prompt</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Problem:</strong> Name the reader?s pain or goal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Promise:</strong> State the outcome you deliver.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proof:</strong> Support with results, reviews, numbers, or demos.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proposal:</strong> Explain what they get and how it works.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prompt:</strong> Give a clear next step (your CTA).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Headline:</em> Ship emails 3? faster without breaking brand guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Body:</em> Templates pre?wired for your style, instant copy suggestions, and a
        built?in checker that catches tone and compliance issues before you send.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Proof:</em> Trusted by 2,500+ teams. Average 28% lift in campaign velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>CTA:</em> Start free ? no credit card.
      </p>

      <h2>Copywriting vs. content writing</h2>
      <p>
        Content writing primarily informs or entertains (think articles, guides, and
        tutorials). Copywriting primarily converts. The two overlap?great content
        includes persuasive elements, and great copy educates just enough to reduce
        friction.
      </p>

      <h2>How to get better</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Interview customers; use their words in your copy.</li>
        <li>Test headlines and calls to action?optimize for clarity and specificity.</li>
        <li>Tighten everything: shorter sentences, active voice, concrete nouns.</li>
        <li>Read aloud; remove anything that sounds fuzzy or ornamental.</li>
        <li>Measure results and iterate. Conversion data is your editor.</li>
      </ul>
